Copy this code and create a bookmark.

Paste this code as the URL. You can name it whatever you want.

Ensure that there are ABSOLUTELY NO spaces or it will not function whatsoever.


javascript:document.body.contentEditable = 'true'; document.designMode='on'; void 0

This will allow you to click on the bookmark then delete and add to the html part of the website.



javascript:document.body.contentEditable = 'false'; document.designMode='off'; void 0

This will stop the editing process but save your progress.
